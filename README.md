## What the Game Is

The Computer Quiz Game quizzes you on four common computer acronyms (CPU, GPU, RAM, PSU). It:

1. Welcomes you and asks if you want to play.  
2. If you agree, it prompts each acronym in turn.  
3. Provides immediate feedback (“Correct!” or “Incorrect!”).  
4. Shows your total score and percentage.  
5. Repeats until you get all four right, then congratulates you and exits.
